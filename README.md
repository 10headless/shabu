IN CASE OF ANY CONFUSION THIS IS AN EXPLANATION OF MY NAMING SCHEME:
- the pre-word ('Alpha', 'Beta') doesn't really mean anything. It's mostly there in case I run out of numbers :) (I don't like versions like 0.10 or 0.11, they are confusing :/ )
- everything with '0.' at the beginning is a snapshot, not really stable
- if it has '1.' it means it's stable
- even though '0.8' has a bigger number after the dot it doesn't mean it's newer than '1.1'. It doesn't mean the opposite either.

Controls: (gamepad in first brackets, keyboard in second)
